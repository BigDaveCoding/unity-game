  - Hey you!!
  - Yeah you, little orange blob thing!
  - Getting warmer, couple steps to the right :)
  - Yo! My name is Gazza. You got to help me out orange dude!
  - The Wizard turned me into a cauldron 200 years ago. I've been stuck here making
    potions ever since :(
  - 'You got to help me escape my friend! '
  - All I need is three flower petals. One Red, One Blue and One Pink.
  - Damn! I can sense the Wizard is coming. Gotta go my dude, hopefully next time
    we meet you have those flower petals!
  - Oh... and I promise I'm totally not evil! You can trust me!
